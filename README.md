# minibots
CuR minibots is an annual fresher's project to introduce newcomers the Robotics Society. The challenge this year is to build a robot that competes with other robots to pick up target objects in an arena. The goal it to successfully take as many targets as possible to the scoring zone in the time given.
I developped the code for gripping blocks and came up with the code for line following code together with my teammates.
